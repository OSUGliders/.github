# Glider Research Group - Oregon State University

The [Glider Research Group](http://gliderfs.coas.oregonstate.edu/gliderweb/) works to understand a diverse range of oceanographic processes, from hypoxia on the US West Coast to mesoscale eddy dynamics in the Western Pacific. We use gliders and a range of other oceanographic tools including moorigns, profilers, drifters, and bow chains. We write open-source code to prepare and analyse oceanographic data.
